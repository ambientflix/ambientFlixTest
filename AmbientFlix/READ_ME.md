# AmbientFlix

AmbientFlix is an application that takes data from your ambient environment and user platforms to make movie recommendations to the user.

## Installation

Go to website and click download code as a zip file. You can then extract it and begin running the program.

## Usage

Please remember to run our application in the FOLLOWING ORDER:

First, run the pythonlib.bat file. This will install the necessary prerequisite libraries for Python. NOTE: THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS ON PYTHON 3. VERSION BELOW PYTHON 3 ARE NOT SUPPORTED.

Second, run the webServer.bat file. This will get our server up and running while the data collection and recommendation engine are booting up with the other file. You do not have to wait while the webServer is booting up: after you launch the bat, go ahead and launch the ambientflix.bat file.

Finally, run the ambientflix.bat file. The console will prompt you for some information before running the program and launching a website of recommended movies.
